I am Zhitian Hou(‰æØÊô∫Â§©), a third-year Master's student in Computer Technology at **[SYSU](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)**, advised by **[Prof. Kun Zeng](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/ZengKun)**. I am currently an intern at **[Infix.ai](https://infix-ai.com/)**, under the supervision of **[Prof. Hongxia Yang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~hongxyang/)**. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in 2023 from SCNU, where I studied in the **[TAM Lab](https://tony-hao.github.io/TAMLab/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Tianyong Hao](https://www.scholat.com/haoty.en)**. 
My current research interests lie primarily in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Medical MLLMs**, with previous research experience in **Legal AI**.

InfiMed-Foundation: Pioneering Advanced Multimodal Medical Models with Compute-Efficient Pre-Training and Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning

Guanghao Zhu, **Zhitian Hou**, Zeyu Liu, Zhijie Sang, Congkai Xie, Hongxia Yang

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses. Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses significant efficiency challenges ...

- This paper provides a comprehensive review of 16 legal LLMs series and 47 LLM-based frameworks for legal tasks, and also gather 15 benchmarks and 29 datasets to evaluate different legal capabilities. Additionally, we analyse the challenges and discuss future directions for LLMbased approaches in the legal domain. We hope this paper provides a systematic introduction for beginners and encourages future research in this field.
