<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Zhitian Hou(‰æØÊô∫Â§©), a second-year Master's student in Computer Technology at **[SYSU](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/)**, advised by **[Prof. Kun Zeng](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/ZengKun)**. I am currently an intern at **[Infix.ai](https://infix-ai.com/)**, under the supervision of **[Prof. Hongxia Yang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~hongxyang/)**. My current research interests lie primarily in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Medical LLMs**, with previous research experience in **Legal AI**.

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in 2023 from SCNU, where I worked in the **[TAM Lab](https://tony-hao.github.io/TAMLab/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Tianyong Hao](https://www.scholat.com/haoty.en)**.

QCSH: Quantization Controlled Semantic Hashing for Effective Similar Text Search

Zihan Ye, **Zhitian Hou**, Ge Lin, Kun Zeng

- We propose an unsupervised novel semantic text hashing framework, Quantization Controlled Semantic Hashing (QCSH), which enhances feature representation while refines the binarization process.

Infi-Med: Low-Resource Medical MLLMs with Robust Reasoning Evaluation

Zeyu Liu$^\*$, **Zhitian Hou$^\*$**, Yining Di, Kejing Yang, Zhijie Sang, Congkai Xie, Jingwen Yang, Siyuan Liu, Jialu Wang, Chunming Li, Ming Li, Hongxia Yang

[**PDF**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23867) 

- We propose Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key innovations: (1) a resource-efficient
approach through curating and constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and (3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across medical modalities and task types.
